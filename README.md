# Application for checking current weather

In this project you will find :

* Clean architecture
* MVVM approach for presentation layer
* **[Koin](https://insert-koin.io/)** for dependency injection approach
* **[Retrofit](https://square.github.io/retrofit/)** for networking
* **[Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/coroutines-overview.html)** for asynchronous operations
* **[Flow](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html)** for observer pattern implementation
* **[Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose)** for app ui

## What was not implemented?

* A multi modules approach. I think it's overkill for the test app.
* Different git branches. In real project of course you need to use different branches.
